# Lux ID

> Decentralized identity and DID solution on Lux Network.

## About
Lux ID is a decentralized identity (DID) platform on Lux Network. It provides self-sovereign identity management, verifiable credentials, and decentralized authentication. Users own and control their identity data without relying on centralized authorities, with post-quantum cryptographic security ensuring long-term identity protection.

## Key Features
- Self-sovereign identity (SSI) with user-controlled data
- W3C Decentralized Identifier (DID) standard compliance
- Verifiable credentials issuance and verification
- Post-quantum secure identity proofs
- Single sign-on across Lux ecosystem applications
- Selective disclosure of identity attributes
- Zero-knowledge identity proofs via Z-Chain
- Recovery mechanisms for lost credentials
- Integration with traditional identity providers
- On-chain identity attestations
